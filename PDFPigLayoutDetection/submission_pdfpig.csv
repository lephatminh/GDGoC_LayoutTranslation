Since\nthe mass spectral exponent for orthogonal Hagedorns (i.e. colorless orthogonal states) is\nfound to be α1 = 3, it is likely that the orthogonal Hagedorn matter undergoes third order\nphase transition to quark-gluon plasma. Furthermore, it is possible that the orthogonal\nNc\nHagedorn states are altered to colorless U(1)\nstates when the very dilute nuclear matter is\nfurther heated up to higher temperatures. The very dilute nuclear matter might be created\nin the pp collisions at LHC besides the heavy ion collisions. The Hagedorn matter which\nis dominated by the colorless U(1)\nNc has the mass spectral exponent α = 3/2. Hence,\nthe nuclear matter that is dominated by these states does not undergo direct abrupt phase\ntransition to quark-gluon plasma but rather smooth cross-over phase transition. When the\nmedium is further heated up to higher temperature these states (i.e. Hagedorn states with\nthe mass spectral exponent α = 3/2) may be mutated to metastable colored quark-gluon\nbags with the mass spectral exponent α = 1/2. Since the states with mass spectral exponent\nα = 1/2 do not pass direct explosive deconﬁnement phase transition to quark-gluon plasma,\nthe colored quark-gluon bags expand smoothly and the system undergoes smooth phase\ntransition to colored quark-gluon plasma.\nNc\nThe orthogonal Hagedorn states are mutated to the colorless U(1)\nquark-gluon bags\ndue to the high thermal excitations in the hot and very dilute nuclear matter (i.e. µB ≈ 0).\nNc\nSince the new nuclear matter turns to be dominated by the colorless U(1)\nquark-gluon\nbags, it does not likely undergo direct phase transition to explosive quark-gluon plasma. But\ninstead, the resultant Hagedorn states are gradually altered to metastable colored quark-\ngluon bubbles. The metastable colored quark-gluon bags expand gradually and overlap\neach other smoothly until the entire space is ﬁlled by giant colored (non-singlet) bags.\nThe resultant matter have an initial neutral color charge aftermath the phase transition.\nTherefore, the constraints of the conserved color charges must be embedded in the system\nthrough the color chemical potentials. This kind of (color-non-singlet) matter with the mass\nspectral exponent αnon undergoes a smooth cross-over phase transition to non-explosive\nquark-gluon plasma. The multi-processes mechanism in the phase transition from the low-\nlying hadronic phase to the quark-gluon plasma strongly indicates the ﬂuid behaviour for the\nquark-gluon plasma. The color-singlet states for the quark-gluon bag with an orthogonal\ncolor representation rather than the unitary one can be interpreted as a gas of Coulomb","blockType":"paragraph","page":1,"blockIndex":0},{"x":293.40033,"y":756.9301,"width":11.726121,"height":7.950208,"text":"52","blockType":"paragraph","page":1,"blockIndex":1}]
