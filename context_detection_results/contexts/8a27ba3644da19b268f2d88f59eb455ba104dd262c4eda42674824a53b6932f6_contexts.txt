α = 1/2 do not pass direct explosive deconﬁnement phase transition to quark-gluon plasma,
the colored quark-gluon bags expand smoothly and the system undergoes smooth phase
transition to colored quark-gluon plasma.

The orthogonal Hagedorn states are mutated to the colorless U(1)

Since the new nuclear matter turns to be dominated by the colorless U(1)

instead, the resultant Hagedorn states are gradually altered to metastable colored quark-
gluon bubbles. The metastable colored quark-gluon bags expand gradually and overlap
each other smoothly until the entire space is ﬁlled by giant colored (non-singlet) bags.
The resultant matter have an initial neutral color charge aftermath the phase transition.
Therefore, the constraints of the conserved color charges must be embedded in the system

bags with the mass spectral exponent α = 1/2. Since the states with mass spectral exponent
α = 1/2 do not pass direct explosive deconﬁnement phase transition to quark-gluon plasma,
the colored quark-gluon bags expand smoothly and the system undergoes smooth phase
transition to colored quark-gluon plasma.

The orthogonal Hagedorn states are mutated to the colorless U(1)
quark-gluon bags
due to the high thermal excitations in the hot and very dilute nuclear matter (i.e. µB ≈ 0).
Nc
Since the new nuclear matter turns to be dominated by the colorless U(1)
quark-gluon
bags, it does not likely undergo direct phase transition to explosive quark-gluon plasma. But
instead, the resultant Hagedorn states are gradually altered to metastable colored quark-
gluon bubbles. The metastable colored quark-gluon bags expand gradually and overlap
each other smoothly until the entire space is ﬁlled by giant colored (non-singlet) bags.
The resultant matter have an initial neutral color charge aftermath the phase transition.
Therefore, the constraints of the conserved color charges must be embedded in the system
through the color chemical potentials. This kind of (color-non-singlet) matter with the mass
spectral exponent αnon undergoes a smooth cross-over phase transition to non-explosive
quark-gluon plasma. The multi-processes mechanism in the phase transition from the low-
lying hadronic phase to the quark-gluon plasma strongly indicates the ﬂuid behaviour for the
quark-gluon plasma. The color-singlet states for the quark-gluon bag with an orthogonal
color representation rather than the unitary one can be interpreted as a gas of Coulomb
