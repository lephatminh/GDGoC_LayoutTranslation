The long,slender,\nhigh-density fuselage with short, thin wings\nproduces a roll inertia which is quite small in\ncomparison to the pitch and yaw inertia.\nThese characteristics are typical of the modern\nairplane configuration.\nThe more conventional\nlow speed airplane may have a wingspan\ngreater than the fuselage length. This type of\nconfiguration produces a relatively large roll\ninertia. A comparison of these configurations\nis shown in figure 4.34.\nInertia coupling can be illustrated by con-\nsidering the mass of the airplane to be con-\ncentrated in two elements, one representing the\nmass ahead of the c.g. and one representing the\nmass behind the c.g. There are two principal\naxis systems to consider: (1) the aerodynamic,\nor wind axis is through the c.g. in the relative\nwind direction, and (2) the inertia axis is\nthrough the c.g. in the direction of the two\nelement masses. This axis system is illus-\ntrated in figure 4.34.\nIf the airplane shown in figure 4.34 were in\nsome flight condition where the inertia axis\nand the aerodynamic axis are alined, no inertia\ncoupling would result from rolling motion.\nHowever, if the inertia axis is inclined to the\naerodynamic axis, rotation about the aero-\ndynamic axis will create centrifugal forces and\ncause a pitching moment. In this case, a\nrolling motion of the aircraft induces a pitch-\ning moment through the action of inertia\nforces. This is “niertia\ncoupling” and is\nillustrated by part B of figure 4.34.\nWhen the airplane is rotated about the\ninertia axis no inertia coupling will exist but\naerodynamic coupling will be present. Part\nC of figure 4.34 shows the airplane after rolling\n90” about the inertia axis. The inclination\nwhich was initially the angle of attack (a) is\nnow the angle of sideslip (-6).\nAlso the\noriginal zero sideslip has now become zero\nangle of attack.

Since\nthe mass spectral exponent for orthogonal Hagedorns (i.e. colorless orthogonal states) is\nfound to be α1 = 3, it is likely that the orthogonal Hagedorn matter undergoes third order\nphase transition to quark-gluon plasma. Furthermore, it is possible that the orthogonal\nNc\nHagedorn states are altered to colorless U(1)\nstates when the very dilute nuclear matter is\nfurther heated up to higher temperatures. The very dilute nuclear matter might be created\nin the pp collisions at LHC besides the heavy ion collisions. The Hagedorn matter which\nis dominated by the colorless U(1)\nNc has the mass spectral exponent α = 3/2. Hence,\nthe nuclear matter that is dominated by these states does not undergo direct abrupt phase\ntransition to quark-gluon plasma but rather smooth cross-over phase transition. When the\nmedium is further heated up to higher temperature these states (i.e. Hagedorn states with\nthe mass spectral exponent α = 3/2) may be mutated to metastable colored quark-gluon\nbags with the mass spectral exponent α = 1/2.

But\ninstead, the resultant Hagedorn states are gradually altered to metastable colored quark-\ngluon bubbles. The metastable colored quark-gluon bags expand gradually and overlap\neach other smoothly until the entire space is ﬁlled by giant colored (non-singlet) bags.\nThe resultant matter have an initial neutral color charge aftermath the phase transition.\nTherefore, the constraints of the conserved color charges must be embedded in the system\nthrough the color chemical potentials. This kind of (color-non-singlet) matter with the mass\nspectral exponent αnon undergoes a smooth cross-over phase transition to non-explosive\nquark-gluon plasma. The multi-processes mechanism in the phase transition from the low-\nlying hadronic phase to the quark-gluon plasma strongly indicates the ﬂuid behaviour for the\nquark-gluon plasma.
